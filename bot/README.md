A self-contained Discord music bot built with Python and `discord.py`. It's designed for easy setup and robust performance, running as a background service using `screen`. The included `launch.sh` script handles the complete setup, including dependency installation, environment configuration, and automatic generation of necessary files like `__init__.py`.

## üéØ Target Environment

This bot is primarily developed and tested on **Debian 12 (Bookworm)**. The `launch.sh` script includes commands to install dependencies like `ffmpeg` using `apt-get`, which is specific to Debian-based distributions.

It is suitable for deployment in various environments:
-   **Bare Metal**: A dedicated physical machine running Debian 12.
-   **Type 1 Hypervisor**:
    -   **Proxmox VE**: Can be run inside a Virtual Machine (VM) or a Linux Container (LXC).
-   **Type 2 Hypervisor**:
    -   **VirtualBox**, **VMware Workstation/Fusion**: Can be run inside a Debian 12 guest VM.

While it may work on other Linux distributions, you might need to manually install the required system dependencies (`ffmpeg`, `libopus-dev`) using your distribution's package manager.

---

## üöÄ Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.9+
- `git`
- `ffmpeg` and `libopus-dev` (The setup script will attempt to install these on Debian-based systems).

### ‚öôÔ∏è Installation & Setup

1.  **Clone the Repository**
    ```bash
    git clone <repository-url>
    cd <repository-directory>
    ```

2.  **Make the Launch Script Executable**
    You may need to grant execute permissions to the launch script.
    ```bash
    chmod +x launch.sh
    ```

3.  **Configure the Bot**
    You can configure the bot in one of two ways:

    **Method 1: Using a `.env` file (Recommended)**
    Create a `.env` file by copying the example file:
    ```bash
    cp .env.example .env
    ```
    Now, edit the `.env` file with your credentials using a text editor like `nano`:
    ```bash
    nano .env
    ```
    See the **Configuration Details** section below for more information on what to put in this file.

    **Method 2: Hardcoding in `config.py`**
    If you prefer, you can hardcode your credentials directly into the `config.py` file.
    ```bash
    nano config.py
    ```
    **Note:** This is not recommended, especially if your code is in a public repository.

4.  **Run the Setup Script**
    This command prepares the environment, installs all Python packages, and makes the other scripts executable.
    ```bash
    ./launch.sh setup
    ```

## üç™ Playing Private Videos

To play private or members-only YouTube videos, you need to provide the bot with your browser's YouTube login cookies.

1.  **Install a Browser Extension**: Install an extension that can export cookies in the Netscape format. A good one for Chrome/Firefox is **'Get cookies.txt LOCALLY'**.
2.  **Export Your YouTube Cookies**: Go to `youtube.com`, make sure you are logged in, and use the extension to export your cookies. Save the file.
3.  **Create the Cookie File**: Open the exported file, copy its contents, and paste them into a new file named `youtube_cookie.txt` in the bot's main directory.
4.  **Restart the Bot**: Use the `?restart` command to apply the changes. The bot will automatically detect and use the cookie file.

**Warning**: Your cookies contain sensitive login information. Do not share them with anyone.

## ‚ú® Recent Updates

-   **Lossless Audio**: The bot now uses the PCM codec to deliver high-fidelity, lossless audio, ensuring the best listening experience.
-   **Live Log Tailing**: The `./launch.sh attach` command now provides a real-time log stream using `tail -f`, making it easier to monitor the bot's activity.
-   **Self-Healing**: The bot can now automatically restart itself if it crashes.

---

## üêõ Bug Fixes

-   **Log Spam on Leave**: Fixed a bug where the bot would continue to spam logs after the `?leave` command was used. The `nowplaying` update task is now properly cancelled.
-   **Interaction Responded Error**: Fixed a bug where the bot would crash if a user clicked the "queue" button multiple times.
-   **Format Not Available Error**: Fixed a bug where the bot would crash if a requested audio format was not available. The bot now selects the best available audio format.
-   **Nowplaying Channel**: Fixed a bug where the `nowplaying` command would only send messages to the log channel. The bot now sends the message to the channel where the command was invoked.
